Ad Auction Dashboard
====================

## Starting the Dashboard

Either double click the jar or use the command:

    java -jar dashboard.jar

## Loading a Campaign

Once you have launched theâ€‰Dashboard, you need to load an auction. If this is 
your first time using it, go to `File > Import Campaign` and navigate to the 
directory with your data. If you have already imported data, go to 
`File > Load Campaign` and select the `*.db` file containing your campaign.

## Using the Dashboard

Once loaded, you will be presented with a Graph. You can now use the different
filters on the left to query, or use Graph Metrics to change graph.
